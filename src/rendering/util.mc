-- ## removeDoubleNames
--
-- During rendering, we generate one page and one documentation block per child.
-- But what if two children have the same name and the same kind?
-- Since they share the same name, namespace and kind, they will end up with the same URL.
-- However, two documentation blocks will still be generated, both pointing
-- toward the last childâ€™s page.
--
-- This function catches all duplicate names among children with same namespace
-- and keeps only the last one. Moreover, if two children
-- with the same namespace are next to each other, we merge their documentation.
-- Otherwise, in this scenario:
--
-- -- Takes x and returns x + 1
-- sem semX: Int -> Int
-- sem semX = | x -> addi x 1
--
-- Since only the last sem remains, the previous documentation would be lost.

-- ## injectTests
--
-- Post-processes a list of `RenderingData` nodes to attach unit tests to their parent
-- documentation blocks.
-- - Iterates through children (`sons`).
-- - Buffers any `RenderingData` elements that correspond to test code.
-- - When a new non-test block (`current`) is encountered, merges the buffered tests
--   into that block by:
--   * Concatenating the test code (`tests`) into the `tests` field
--   * Concatenating their raw rows (`row`) into the `rowTests` field
-- - Clears the buffer after attaching tests.
--
-- Returns: the transformed list of `RenderingData`, where test blocks are folded into
-- the corresponding parent documentation block.
